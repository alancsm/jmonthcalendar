# jMonthCalendar #

jMonthCalendar is a full month calendar that supports events written as a plugin for jQuery. You simply initialize the calendar with options and an events array and it can handle the rest.

|<b>General Notice</b>|I am looking for some help from people to maintain this project, there are many requested features and I can't get to all of them on my own quickly enough.|
